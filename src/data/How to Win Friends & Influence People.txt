It takes something extraordinary for a book to remain a best seller fully 80 years after it was first published. Dale Carnegie wrote this book in 1937, offering practical advice in how to get along with others, understand their point of view, and influence them to your own. It is a testament to the importance of human relationships that even now, in fact ESPECIALLY now, in our internet age and when many of our interactions are via e-mail or text or social media, there continues to be a realization of the importance of human to human contact and relationship.
I highly recommend for people who want to improve their relationship building and communication skills.
I've got to improve a lot my soft skills at work. Awesome book! recommend it!
My dad gave this to me as a gift and I loved it! I have noticed such an improvement in interpersonal skills since reading this book and applying the principles in everyday interactions.
