Beautiful and sleek pen, it's not thick, feels solid (made of metal), easy to load the ink, it takes a few minutes to the ink to reach the nib but once it make it, all is smooth.
The product arrived in perfect conditions the shipment was fast, the pen works perfectly it gives a new style to my handwriting and looks better that I thought also the case is really elegant , it is a perfect option for a nice present, my boss really love it !!!
My first fountain pen. I have to hand write a lot of thank you notes now for work and there is just something different about writing with a fountain pen that flows. No pressure no hand cramps. I also recommend you get the ink cartridges that they recommend. They are much better than others. They are also good on there word that says the company will assist you if you have problems.
This company crafts absolutely elegant products. I have purchased multiple pens by them last year for myself and as a gift. They add a sense of professionalism when sighted and I always get compliments on them. Good for students, writers, and for business.
This is a really great pen. I ordered two of them after previously ordering some ZenZoi products. I saw another teachers at school that had them and the packaging looked good, so I am glad I took a chance.
This is a nice pen as a gift or to use everyday if you're taking notes for school. My wife uses pens everyday and really loved this one because it fits nice in hand and writes well. She's gone back to school so she's always taking notes by hand.
