The layout is clear, the construction is of good quality.
The panda planner is really nice. It's got a nice hard cover that feels elegant and nice, heavy paper. It's somewhat like a journal and planner all in one. 
I purchased this as a parting gift to my boss as he was transferring to another department. He really appreciated it and said it was very useful.
I really wanted to give this planner a 5 star review because I love the concept behind it. The reason why I gave it 3 stars was because it doesn't really work as an everyday planner for a student, mother, and wife.
I don't like the way that the monthly weekly and daily sheets are separated. I like mine to be together. I don't like how much information was on the daily sheets.
From the very first day I filled it out until now, two weeks later I feel more productive and I'm accomplishing more of my goals simply because I laid them out.
I highly recommend if you're someone like me who wants to do a lot/has to keep up with a lot of things like school, work, personal projects and fitness goals. Also, one nice touch is there are 4 bookmark strings so u can easily flip to your current day/week/month. This planner was well thought out.
