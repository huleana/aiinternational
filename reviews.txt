I have a new girlfriend and I want to make her happy in our anniversary.
I just got a promotion. I'm feeling confident. I want to reward myself.
I have a hangover.
I want to relax and go on a vacation.
Next week is Mother's Day. I want to buy something useful for her.
I want to book a hotel room with a comfortable bed.
