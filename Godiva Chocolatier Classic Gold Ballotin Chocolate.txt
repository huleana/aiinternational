It was a gift and I was so embarrassed when I found out it arrived completely melted!! Ugh!!! Really? No cooler packs in a Godiva high fat content chocolate shipped to California? So upset. Waste of money.
Chocolate looked old & faded. Wrapped pieces were melted inside wrapper as were almost all of the pieces were melted & misshaped ~not much of a Mothers Day gift.
Very disappointed. Love Godiva Chocolates, but these were old, had turned a gray color, were crumbly.
It will be a very long time before I buy anymore Godiva Chocolates from anywhere. They were the worst!
This looks like a 16-piece but it is actually a 19-piece as the description states, if you look under the solid dark chocolate piece you will see another dark chocolate, a milk chocolate and a white chocolate piece. Awesome variety too. Really enjoyed the white chocolate raspberry, the truffles and all of the beautiful shapes that look handmade.
